# FOD "Forward genetic dissection of inherited predisposition to Psoroptic Mange in Belgian Blue Cattle."

Psoroptic mange (PM) is an ectoparasitic dermatosis due to Psoroptes ovis. The occurrence of PM is extremely frequent in Belgian Blue Cattle (BBC) and in this breed a delayed hypersensitivity response is present. BBC, or at least some animals in that breed, are likely to carry genes that increase susceptibility to PM.

The aim of this project is twofold:

At first a positional cloning approach is used to identify the genetic determinants underlying PM susceptibility in BBC in order to select for BBC with increased PM resistance.

Secondly, the significant loci underlying PM susceptibility in BBC will be further characterized in order to scrutinize the mechanism involved in the delayed hypersensitivity response.

At least 1000 animals will be genotyped using a genome wide SNP panel and will be characterized for their PM susceptibility using clinical and immunological measures. The data will be analyzed in order to

(i) identify non-genetic “fixed” effects influencing incidence/severity of PM, 
(ii) estimate the heritability of susceptibility to PM in BBC, 
(iii) map loci and genes influencing susceptibility to PM and 
(iv) develop statistical models to enhance resistance to PM in BBC by genomic selection.

Significant loci will be further characterized to identify the causative mutations.
